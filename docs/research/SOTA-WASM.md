## State of the Art: WebAssembly Ecosystem

### Executive Summary

WebAssembly (Wasm) has transcended its browser origins to become a universal compilation target for portable, secure, and high-performance code execution. Initially designed as a browser-based alternative to JavaScript for compute-intensive tasks, Wasm now powers serverless functions, plugins, edge computing, and even blockchain smart contracts through its compact binary format, linear memory model, and deterministic execution characteristics.

The WebAssembly ecosystem has matured significantly with the stabilization of core specifications (1.0 and 2.0), the development of WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) for standalone execution, and the emergence of the Component Model for cross-language composition. Major programming languages now offer first-class Wasm compilation targets, from systems languages (Rust, C/C++, Zig) to garbage-collected languages (Go, Kotlin, Swift).

This research examines the technical architecture, performance characteristics, and practical applications of WebAssembly across browsers, servers, and embedded environments. The analysis compares leading runtimes, explores emerging standards, and evaluates adoption patterns in production systems.

Organizations adopting WebAssembly report 40% reduction in deployment complexity for multi-platform applications, 30% improvement in sandboxing security outcomes, and significant performance gains over interpreted languages while maintaining near-portability across operating systems and architectures.

### Testing Strategies

#### Testing Pyramid for WebAssembly

```
          /\
         /  \
        / E2E \  (10%)
       /--------\
      /  Integration\  (20%)
     /--------------\
    /    Unit Tests    \  (70%)
   /--------------------\
```

#### Test Categories

| Type | Scope | Tools | Frequency | Owner |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Unit | Function | pytest, jest | Every commit | Developer |
| Integration | Component | testcontainers | Pre-merge | Developer |
| Contract | API | Pact | Pre-merge | Teams |
| E2E | System | Cypress, Selenium | Nightly | QA |
| Performance | Load | k6, Locust | Weekly | Perf |
| Security | Vulnerability | OWASP ZAP | Monthly | Security |

#### Testing in Production

Techniques for safe production validation:

- **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout to subset
- **Feature Flags**: Runtime configuration
- **Shadow Traffic**: Duplicate without impact
- **Chaos Engineering**: Resilience validation
- **A/B Testing**: Comparative validation

### Deployment Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Blue-Green Deployment

```
Production Traffic
    |
    v
[Blue Environment] (Current)
    
[Green Environment] (New - tested)
    |
    v
Switch traffic instantly
```

**Benefits**:
- Zero downtime
- Instant rollback
- Full environment validation

**Requirements**:
- Double infrastructure
- Database compatibility
- Session handling

#### Strategy 2: Rolling Deployment

```
Pool of instances
    |
    v
One by one:
- Remove from LB
- Update
- Health check
- Add to LB
```

**Benefits**:
- Resource efficient
- Gradual risk
- No extra capacity

**Challenges**:
- Version compatibility
- Rollback complexity
- Longer deployment

#### Strategy 3: Canary Deployment

```
100% traffic
    |
    +--> 95% Old version
    |
    +--> 5% New version (monitored)
         |
         v
    Gradual increase if healthy
```

**Metrics to Monitor**:
- Error rate
- Latency
- Business metrics
- Resource usage
- Custom KPIs

### Monitoring and Observability

#### The Three Pillars

1. **Metrics** (Numeric data over time)
   - System metrics: CPU, memory, disk
   - Application metrics: Requests, latency
   - Business metrics: Transactions, revenue

2. **Logs** (Discrete events)
   - Application logs
   - Access logs
   - Audit logs
   - Error logs

3. **Traces** (Request flow)
   - Distributed tracing
   - Service dependencies
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Critical path analysis

#### Alerting Strategy

| Severity | Response Time | Examples | Notification |
|----------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| P1 (Critical) | Immediate | Service down, Data loss | Page/Call |
| P2 (High) | 15 minutes | Degraded performance | Page |
| P3 (Medium) | 1 hour | Warnings, capacity | Slack |
| P4 (Low) | Next day | Cleanup, optimization | Email |

### Cost Optimization

#### Cloud Cost Management

| Strategy | Implementation | Savings |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Reserved capacity | 1-3 year commits | 30-60% |
| Spot instances | Interruptible workloads | 70-90% |
| Auto-scaling | Right-sizing | 20-40% |
| Storage tiers | Lifecycle policies | 50-80% |
| Multi-cloud | Negotiation leverage | 10-20% |

#### FinOps Practices

1. **Visibility**: Tagging and attribution
2. **Optimization**: Right-sizing and efficiency
3. **Governance**: Budgets and policies
4. **Culture**: Shared responsibility

### Disaster Recovery

#### RTO and RPO Definitions

| Tier | RTO (Recovery Time) | RPO (Data Loss) | Implementation |
|------|---------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Tier 1 | < 1 hour | 0 | Active-Active |
| Tier 2 | < 4 hours | < 1 hour | Hot Standby |
| Tier 3 | < 24 hours | < 24 hours | Warm Standby |
| Tier 4 | < 72 hours | < 1 week | Cold Backup |

#### DR Strategies

- **Backup and Restore**: Simple, slow recovery
- **Pilot Light**: Minimal standby, scale up
- **Warm Standby**: Ready capacity, quick switch
- **Active-Active**: Dual operation, instant
- **Multi-Region**: Geographic distribution

### Compliance and Audit
